- open dev sdk and import file from dist. Didn't register domain, so please tick Detail -> do not check illegal domain
- It was an interesting project but my home computer has stayed in dust for ages, had a hard time upgrading everything.
- Connected to mongd but somehow, socket.io connection was not successful... :( If I have more time, I will try websocket on web side on my own first.
